# Diabetes_prediction

In this project, our objective is to create models to predict diabetes at an early stage, based on various features like Age, Gender, Polyuria, Polydipsia, sudden weight loss, weakness, Polyphagia, Genital thrush, visual blurring, Itching, Irritability, delayed healing, partial paresis, muscle stiffness, Alopecia, Obesity. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.
